 ## Vite.js with Vue 3 and TypeScript

This project demonstrates how to set up a development environment for building Vue 3 applications using Vite.js and TypeScript.

### Prerequisites

To follow this guide, you will need the following:

- Node.js (version 16 or later)
- npm (version 7 or later)
- A code editor (such as Visual Studio Code)

### Project Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/vite-vue3-typescript.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory.

```bash
cd vite-vue3-typescript
```

3. Install the project dependencies.

```bash
npm install
```

### Development Server

To start the development server, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start a Vite development server on port 5000. The server will automatically rebuild the application whenever you make changes to the source code.

### Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

```
├── src
│   ├── App.vue
│   ├── components
│   │   ├── HelloWorld.vue
│   │   └── Counter.vue
│   ├── main.ts
│   └── router.ts
├── vite.config.ts
├── package.json
├── README.md
```

- The `src` directory contains the source code for the application.
- The `App.vue` file is the root component of the application.
- The `components` directory contains the Vue components used in the application.
- The `main.ts` file is the entry point of the application.
- The `router.ts` file configures the Vue Router for the application.
- The `vite.config.ts` file configures the Vite build tool.
- The `package.json` file contains the project dependencies and configuration.
- The `README.md` file is the project documentation.

### Running the Application

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Start the development server by running the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

2. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000`.

The application will be displayed in the browser.

### Conclusion

This project provides a basic setup for building Vue 3 applications
